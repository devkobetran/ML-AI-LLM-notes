# Generative AI programming tools

## Generative AI in java development

- Amazon QDeveloper
  - Catches errors
  - suggests improvement
  - handles repetitive tasks
  - real time feedback
  - helpful suggestions
  - clear explanations

## Introduction to prompt engineering

- Prompt engineering involves crafting precise inputs to elicit the most useful and accurate outputs from AI models.
- A poorly phrased query might generate irrelevant code suggestions, but a well-structured prompt can guide the tool to generate a complete function or even debug an issue in your code.

### Prompt engineering types

- Instruction-based Prompts
  - direct and specific
  - tell the AI exactly what to do
  - ideal for straightforward tasks
  - By providing precise instructions, you ensure the AI produces relevant and accurate results
- Few-Shot Prompting
  - provides examples to guide the AI's response.
  - helpful when you want the output to follow a specific pattern or structure.
- Zero-Shot Prompting
  - involves asking the AI to perform a task without providing any examples
  - It’s most effective for straightforward tasks that don’t require additional context or explanation.
  - This approach relies on the AI’s existing knowledge of common tasks.
  - works best when the task is universally understood or when the expected output is self-explanatory.
- Chain-of-Thought Prompting
  - guides the AI to solve problems step by step.
  - ideal for complex tasks requiring logical reasoning or multiple steps.
  - This approach encourages the AI to think through the solution, ensuring that the response includes both the reasoning and the final result.
  - useful for tasks that involve multiple logical steps or require a detailed explanation of the process.
- Role-based Prompting
  - assigns the AI a specific persona, which can help tailor the response to match a desired tone or style
  - useful when you need explanations or answers framed in a specific way.
- Contextual Prompts
  - includes background information or a specific scenario to tailor the AI's response.
  - useful when the response needs to be relevant to a particular use case.

### Best Practices for Prompts

- Be clear and specific
- Provide context
- Use examples
- Experiment and iterate
- Be concise
  - Avoid unnecessary information that could confuse the AI.
