# Business Challenges

## Scalability

- Need Low latency
- Use parallel processing
- Load Balancing: distribute user requests across multiple servers
- Elasticity: Scale resources based on demand
- What is one of the key challenges in scaling AI systems to handle large volumes of data and high user demand?
  - Real-time data processing

## Interpretability and transparency

- Crucial for understanding how decisions are made
- Interpretability: the ability to explain or understand how a ML model makes its decisions.
  - Decision Tracking: steps the AI took to make a decision
  - Issue identification: transparency makes it easer to spot and fix problems.
  - Continuous improvement: the model is refined for better accuracy and reliability
  - User trust
- Transparency: ensures that the inner workings of an AI model are clear and understandable to all stakeholders
- Why are interpretability and transparency particularly important in AI models used for healthcare or finance applications?
  - They help stakeholders understand and trust the model’s predictions and decisions.

## Improving Model Transparency

- **LIME** (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) is a technique that explains the predictions of complex models by approximating them with simpler, interpretable models.
  - In a credit scoring example, LIME can show why a low score was assigned, highlighting factors like income or credit history. This transparency builds trust and ensures fairness.
- **SHAP** (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a method that explains the output of machine learning models by assigning each feature an importance value based on cooperative game theory.

## Integration with Existing Systems

- Which of the following are challenges businesses face when integrating AI with supply chain management systems? Select all that apply.
  - Employee training required to interpret AI-generated insights -
  - Data scattered across multiple sources and formats
  - High initial costs and scalability concerns

## Ethical & Regulatory Compliance

- What is one primary ethical or regulatory challenge businesses face when deploying AI solutions like Generative AI?
  - Ensuring compliance with data protection laws like GDPR

## Compliance in Action

### Understanding ethics in AI

- In this example of a job hiring company:
- Fairness: AI should provide equal opportunities and unbiased decisions, regardless of gender, race, age, or background.
- Transparency: Users should clearly understand how and why AI makes decisions.
- Privacy: Protecting personal data—like resumes or interview recordings—is non-negotiable.
- Accountability: Clear responsibility must be established for errors or unintended consequences.
- Safety: Systems should be designed to avoid harm to individuals and society.
