# Introduction to AI

## Introduction to Generative Artificial Intelligence

### Discriminative AI

- **Discriminative AI**: makes decisions and predictions by analyzing and classifying data.
  - Acts as an evaluator.
- **Generative AI**: acts as a creator.
  - creates new content based on what it learns during training.
  - innovator
- Examples of Gen AI:
  - text generation like chatGPT
  - image generation
  - music synthesis
- AI simplify complex ideas

## How generative AI works

- Gen AI learns from datasets
  - text
  - images
  - code
- Gen AI learns the features and patterns it's fed.
- It's like a chef understanding ingredients to generate recipes for specific needs.
- Building blocks of Gen AI: large datasets
- Gen AI:
  - identifies patterns
  - learns rules
  - extracts information
- Gen AI can
  - complete
  - improve
  - debug
  - optimize

## Generative AI in software development

- AI in planning phase:
  - Identify the functional requirements and architectual styles from business needs.
- AI in Development phase:
  - proposes boilerplates
  - writes complex algorithms
  - optimize current code
- AI in testing phase:
  - automates unit and integration tests.
- AI in deployment phase:
  - recommends configurations for deployment
  - monitors for potential issues
- AI in maintenance phase:
  - monitors for bug detection
  - automatic documentation updates

### Boost in productivity

- Code suggestions
- Code autocomplete or completion ideas
- Method generation

### Limitations

- Accuracy issues
  - may contain bugs or out-dated suggestions
  - fail to account for
    - rounding inconsistencies
    - empty carts
    - invalid input
    - etc
- Developers should still consider edge cases

### Ethical concerns

- suggestions might contain copyright or proprietary code that you shouldn't use or need permission to use.

### Waning Personal skills

- relying on AI might dampen down your programming skills over time.

### Tips

- Use AI for efficiency
  - Automate repetitive tasks
  - Generate initial drafts
- Use human oversight to ensure code meets project standards.

## Ethical Considerations and impact

### Data Privacy

- Datasets can include personal data
  - AI could potentially remember and reproduce sensitive info.
- Example: customer service AI trained on transcripts of real customer interactions.
  - Names of customers might be removed
  - But addresses and customer's credit card numbers can potentially be revealed in the AI response.
    - Thus, unintentional privacy breaches can occur.
- AI can generate unsecured code.
  - For example, unsecured code can be generated to manage user's sensitive data to be stored in the database, leading to possile breaches.
- AI can suggest proprietary code in a public repo, which another developer might unknowingly use, violating property rights.
- AI models need to improve on these issues.

### Generating harmful or misleading content

- Generative AI can be misused to create harmful outputs, ranging from fake news articles to malicious code.
  - e.g. deep fakes can trick people
  - e.g. hackers can taken advantage of developers that utilize malicious code generated from Gen AI.

### The societal impacts of GenAI

#### Effect on job markets

- Prevents junior engineers from joining job market.
- Needed retraining and upskilling of employees to stay competitive in AI driven market.

#### Copyright and intellectual property issues

- Legal challenges if AI copies proprietary code or is really similar to it.

#### The need for regulation

- European Union’s AI Act (2024): Categorizes AI systems based on risk levels and ensures that high-risk applications meet strict standards.
- United States’ AI Bill of Rights (2024): Provides guidelines to safeguard privacy, civil rights, and transparency in AI systems.
- China’s AI Regulations (2023-2024): Emphasizes innovation and national security while enforcing tight controls on AI development.
- Workers may face job displacement if they lack access to reskilling opportunities, highlighting the need for legal provisions that support workforce development in AI-driven industries.
- Unchecked biases in GenAI systems could perpetuate discrimination and reinforce inequalities, emphasizing the importance of regulations to ensure fairness and inclusivity.
- Privacy violations, threats to civil liberties, and a lack of transparency could arise without proper safeguards, leading to mistrust and potential societal instability.
- GenAI-generated social media content and deepfakes could manipulate public perception, fueling misinformation and causing significant societal disruption.
- High-risk applications, such as AI tools used in healthcare, require stringent safety and accuracy standards to prevent harm and ensure public trust.

### Critical thinking: Sensitive applications of GenAI

- News generation
  - The AI could prioritize sensational headlines over factual accuracy, undermining trust in news sources.
  - To address these risks, it is essential for news organizations to implement strict human oversight when using AI, ensuring that journalistic integrity and accuracy remain at the forefront.
- Deepfakes
  - It’s essential to develop and implement tools that can accurately detect AI-generated content, ensuring the responsible use of this technology and protecting public trust to mitigate these dangers.
